# Please-Help
Now I typed the Repository name a yellow info box popped up BLOCKING the text below the Repository name field Genius!
I have a Screen Capture showing the yellow box blocking I am sure important information for the user but have no clue how to add it to this page, somewhere I seen bragging on being able to add photos to GitHub but cant remember where and have no clue where to find the instructions for adding photos. 

I spent over 5 minutes trying to figure out how to create a "New Branch" mainly looking for the "BLUE BUTTON" to click on as INSTRUCTED to do in these instructions https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ there is NO BLUE BUTTON until you hover over the WHITE button that DOES NOT even look like a button until you move your mouse over it, who writes these instructions? Youd think instructions writtrn for nubies like myself would be clear and precise? 

So where do I go to report this so the newbie instructions can be clairfied I found nothing on that page that gives a hint on who to contact or even who the authors are, no links no email nothing, guess they do not want feedback? So now I have wasted almost 10 minuted of my life just creating a "New Branch", looking for support link to report the problems I encountered and writing this message nobody will probably read.
